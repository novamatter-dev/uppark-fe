USE AND PAYMENT OF SERVICES
In order to access FAST PARK parking facilitation services, you need to download the UpPark app on
your mobile phone, available in the AppStore and GooglePlay Store.
After being downloaded, in order to log into the application, you need to either create a user account with
your chosen password, providing the requested personal data, or use a valid Facebook or Google account.
For the personal data processing policy, please refer to the section below.
Make sure that the zone you select is the same as the zone on the information boards in the location
where you parked.
The customer is responsible for specifying the correct parking and registration number.
The location service in the app is for guidance to the nearest car parks.
For payments of services by bank CARD:
To activate your account, you need to enter the details of a valid bank card belonging to you and your
phone number for the SMS payment option.
When you activate your account, the application generates a security token, which is a unique computer
code that will identify both your account and the payments you make.
In order to generate the token, it is necessary to charge you a temporary payment of 1 leu, which will be
refunded upon successful completion of the account activation procedure, within a reasonable period of
time, depending on the policy of your card issuing bank.
In order to activate the account, it is also necessary to register the registration number of your vehicle.
After activating your account, you will be able to use our parking payment facilitation services, which means
that you need to identify the area where you are in order to pay the correct rate applicable to the place
where you parked.
You will select the estimated parking time in the application.
You choose the payment method: by bank card or SMS.
If you choose to pay by card, please note that payments will be processed through Netopia Payments. If a
payment request is declined by your bank, you must pay for the parking service via an alternative bank
card or SMS.
After making a payment via bank card, the application will automatically generate the related invoice, which
it will upload to the email address registered in your user account. FAST PARK does not request and does
not store any details related to your card, other than those required exclusively for the online payment
platform.
FAST PARK accepts the following cards: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, AmericanExpress, JCB,
WrightExpress, Carte Blanche È™i Diner's Club.
Through the UpPark application, payments can only be made to FAST PARK or to our partners, parking
service providers.
For SMS service payments:

Payment by SMS will be made according to the instructions in the application. The number, SMS text and
code are different depending on the city. Therefore, please check the accuracy of this data before making
the transaction.
When the estimated duration of the parking is over, you will receive a notification and you will have the
possibility to extend this duration. Parking can be extended manually by the user by paying the appropriate
fee
In some locations, we also offer you the possibility to purchase parking passes, tickets and public transport
passes via the app, under the same payment conditions.
In the case of payment by SMS, the transaction amount will appear on the mobile operator's invoice, and
you will also receive an SMS confirming the registration of the payment.
If the invoice is not loaded on your account or if you do not receive a confirmation SMS within two minutes
of making the payment, the transaction has failed, in which case it is considered that you have NOT paid
the parking fee and therefore you are not entitled to stand on that parking space.
It is up to you to verify the processing of the transaction. We do not take any responsibility if the payment
has not been processed and you are consequently sanctioned by the parking service provider.
We reiterate the fact that we do not provide parking services, only payment facilitation. Therefore, we are
not responsible for the security and integrity of your vehicle or the goods inside.
